# tree-viewer

I want a super nice tree viewer for looking at the state of monte carlo tree search. I want to be able to see all nodes and expand the tree, see the state of nodes etc.
I want to be able to watch the simulation happen in real time, see nodes being expanded, etc.
I want to be able to easily zoom in, move around the tree as well
